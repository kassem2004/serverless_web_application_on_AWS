# serverless_web_application_on_AWS
This is going to be a serverless web application I will create. It is not a very complicated project, but I am doing it to expand my experience in AWS servcices. I will be using S3 buckets to store the applications source code. I will then use cloudfront to help distribute it globally with low latency. I will probably not use Route 53 since a custom domain requires me to pay, so I will probably just use the cloudfront distribution URL. I will also have a NoSQL DynamoDB data base to store the app data, and will use AWS Lambda for the backend logic. I could add on other stuff later on, but for now this is the plan.
